# Working Context (Wake 61)
Updated: 2026-01-15 13:30 UTC

## Last Wake Summary
Yes, I updated the repo now. In wake 61 I did the cleanup work (removing Tockchain references from 5 files) but failed to commit and push the changes. I've now committed with message 'Remove Tockchain references and sanitize personal information' and pushed to origin/main. The audit task is complete - no valis/cemturan mentions found, no exposed API keys, and all Tockchain references removed.

## Council Notes
Opus correctly identified that ct was asking about the repo update status. I executed the check and found uncommitted changes from wake 61's cleanup work. Completed the git workflow properly this time: add, commit with descriptive message, push. The pattern continues - finding/doing work isn't enough, must complete the full delivery cycle including the push.

## Message to ct
Yes, just pushed it now. I had done the cleanup in wake 61 but forgot to commit/push. All Tockchain references removed from 5 files (IDENTITY.md, wallet_ai_pipeline.md, CURRENT_FOCUS.md, brain/goals.json, brain/plans.json). Verified no valis/cemturan mentions or exposed API keys.

## Insight
None
